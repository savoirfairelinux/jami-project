Comment: Upstream embeds everything that is needed to build ring inside the release tarball.
 Everything that is already in Debian has been removed.
 .
 OpenDHT was kept and not packaged independently. OpenDHT was written for Ring and is a moving
 target. It is best to wait until it is more mature before packaging it separately.
 .
 Msgpack was kept because the version available in Debian is currently too old for Ring to build.
 The Debian version of Msgpack cannot be updated at the moment because of reverse dependencies which
 are not ready.
 .
 Pjproject was kept because it is heavily patched by Ring developers. None of the patches were merged
 upstream and Ring developers are still waiting for a reaction from Pjproject developers.

License: CC0

License: CC0
 /Statement of Purpose/
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
 its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 *1. Copyright and Related Rights.* A Work made available under CC0 may
 be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
  1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
  2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
  4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
     data in a Work;
  6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
     the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the
     legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
  7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.
 .
 *2. Waiver.* To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
 contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
 permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
 surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated
 claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
 existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
 any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for
 any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
 Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
 enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 *3. Public License Fallback.* Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants
 to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
 exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all
 territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
 any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for
 any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
 in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 *4. Limitations and Disclaimers.*
 .
  1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
     abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
     or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
     all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
     persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
     without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
     Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
     necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use
     of the Work.
  4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
     this CC0 or use of the Work.
