# Differences and compatibility with official debian.org package

This source package also provides binary package ring-all. ring-all is an
all-in-one package that is it ships both the Ring Daemon and the GNOME
client. This package is not available in the debian.org repositories (not
needed in the Debian case).

ring-all allows easy installation of Ring as a single package from ring.cx.
The reason is that one cannot register a repository in source.list.d and
directly use it to fetch the dependencies. As a consequence it is not
possible to have a one-click installation with two binary packages. That's
why we build ring-all.

ring-all conflicts with ring and ring-daemon since they are distributing the
same files.
