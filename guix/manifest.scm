;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; A full-blown development environment that can be used to build the
;;; whole project.  It includes both the GNOME as well as the Qt
;;; libraries, so that both clients can be built.  The sensitive
;;; (i.e., patched) dependencies are consciously omitted from this
;;; list so that the bundled libraries are the ones used, which is
;;; usually what is desired for development purposes.

;;; The make-jami.py script makes use of it to build Jami in a Linux
;;; container with the dependencies below when Guix is detected (and
;;; no /etc/os-release file exists) or when explicitly specified,
;;; e.g.:
;;;
;;; $ ./make-jami.py --distribution=guix --install
;;;
;;; It can also be invoked directly to spawn a development environment, like so:
;;;
;;; $ guix environment --pure --manifest=guix/manifest.scm
