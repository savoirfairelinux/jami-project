Comment: Upstream embeds everything that is needed to build ring inside the release tarball.
 Everything that is already in Debian has been removed.
 .
 OpenDHT was kept and not packaged independently. OpenDHT was written for Ring and is a moving
 target. It is best to wait until it is more mature before packaging it separately.
 .
 Msgpack was kept because the version available in Debian is currently too old for Ring to build.
 The Debian version of Msgpack cannot be updated at the moment because of reverse dependencies which
 are not ready.
 .
 Pjproject was kept because it is heavily patched by Ring developers. None of the patches were merged
 upstream and Ring developers are still waiting for a reaction from Pjproject developers.
 See the relevant threads:
  - http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2014-October/017905.html
  - http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2015-January/018072.html
  - http://lists.pjsip.org/pipermail/pjsip_lists.pjsip.org/2016-April/019196.html
 .
 libiax2 was kept because it is a version of the library hosted and maintained by Savoir-Faire Linux
 for the Ring project.
